This is a bookdown template that has rmarkdown page for each item in a two level outline.  I've removed citations and bibliographies to make it as clean as possible.  But I have modified the custome style.css to change the formating of the book title, author and date lines.    

It is a modification of the Sean Kross' book at http://seankross.com/bookdown-start/
